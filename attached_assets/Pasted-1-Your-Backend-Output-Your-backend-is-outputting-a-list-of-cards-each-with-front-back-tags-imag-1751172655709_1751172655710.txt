1. Your Backend Output
Your backend is outputting a list of cards, each with:
front, back, tags
image (with url and caption)
mnemonic
vignette (with clinical_case and explanation)
This matches the expected input for your Flask/genanki backend.
2. Your Card Screenshot
The card displays the question, answer, vignette, and click-to-reveal explanation.
However, there is no image visible on the card.
3. Does the Current System Work?
What Works:
The backend is correctly parsing and formatting the card data.
The clinical vignette, answer, and explanation are rendered as expected.
The JSON structure is correct for your backend.
What’s Not Working:
Images are not appearing on the cards.
4. Why Aren’t Images Appearing?
Based on your code and the backend output, here are the most likely reasons:
A. Image Download/Embedding Issues
The backend downloads the image to a temp directory and adds the full path to media_files.
The HTML in the card references the image by its filename (e.g., <img src="image_xxx.jpg">).
If the image is not included in the .apkg media, or the filename in the HTML does not match the filename in the media, the image will not show.
B. genanki Media Handling
genanki.Package.media_files should be a list of file paths (not filenames).
The HTML in the card should reference only the filename, not the full path.
C. Anki Import
If the .apkg is imported into Anki and the media is missing or the filename is mismatched, the image will not display.
5. How to Fix
Checklist:
Ensure the image is downloaded and saved to a temp file.
Add the full temp file path to media_files.
Reference only the filename in the HTML (<img src="image_xxx.jpg">).
After generating the .apkg, open it with a tool like Anki or an apkg explorer and check if the image file is present.
If you use a temp directory, make sure the file is not deleted before the .apkg is created.
Your Code Already Does This:
Apply to medical_flas...
)
This is correct.
6. Debugging Steps
Check the .apkg file: After generating, open it with a zip tool. Is the image file present?
Check the HTML: In Anki, right-click the card and select "Edit HTML" or "Show Source"—is the <img src="..."> referencing the correct filename?
Check the temp directory: Are the images being deleted before the package is created?
7. Conclusion
Your backend output is correct.
Your system should work, but images are not showing due to a packaging or filename mismatch.
If you follow the checklist above, images should appear.
