        "vignette": "A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident complaining of acute neck pain radiating down her arm. She notes severe burning and tingling sensations. MRI of the spine is unremarkable for fracture but reveals possible nerve root irritation. Which spinal tract is most likely responsible for transmitting the patient's pain sensation?\n\nA. Lateral corticospinal tract\nB. Anterior spinothalamic tract\nC. Lissauer's tract\nD. Dorsal column-medial lemniscus\nE. Spinocerebellar tract\n\nCorrect Answer: C. <span class=\"highlight-red\">Lissauer's tract</span>\nExplanation: Lissauer's tract allows for the transmission of pain and temperature by carrying primary afferents fibers that can communicate with several spinal cord levels.",
