"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room due to multiple bruises and petechiae after a minor fall. His mother states that he has had unusual nosebleeds and experiences excessive bleeding during dental procedures. A complete blood count shows markedly low platelet counts and the platelets are described as small on the blood smear. Further testing reveals that this is consistent with a genetic disorder.",
