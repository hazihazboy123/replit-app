# Medical JSON to Anki Converter

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that converts JSON-formatted medical flashcard data into advanced Anki deck files (.apkg). Designed specifically for medical students, it supports high-yield card highlighting, cloze deletions, hierarchical tags, image embedding, and notes sections. Users can either upload a JSON file or paste JSON data directly into a web form to generate downloadable Anki flashcard decks optimized for medical education.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: HTML templates with Bootstrap 5 for styling
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap with dark theme and Bootstrap Icons
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for form validation and UX enhancements
- **Layout**: Responsive design with navbar, main content area, and footer

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Application Structure**: Simple monolithic architecture with separation of concerns
- **Main Components**:
  - `main.py`: Application entry point
  - `app.py`: Flask application factory and main logic
  - `FlashcardProcessor`: Class handling JSON validation and Anki deck generation

### Data Processing
- **Enhanced JSON Validation**: Validates medical card structure supporting Q&A or cloze formats
- **Advanced Anki Generation**: Uses `genanki` with unique model/deck IDs and medical-focused templates
- **Medical Card Features**: High-yield highlighting, cloze deletions, hierarchical tags, notes sections
- **File Handling**: Secure temporary file creation for deck downloads with stable GUID generation

## Key Components

### FlashcardProcessor Class
- Validates enhanced JSON structure for medical flashcard data
- Creates advanced Anki models with medical-focused styling and templates
- Supports both basic Q&A and cloze deletion card types
- Generates downloadable .apkg files with unique IDs for proper Anki tracking
- Handles high-yield flagging, hierarchical tags, and notes sections
- Implements stable GUID generation for consistent card updates

### Web Interface
- Single-page application with file upload and text input options
- Form validation to ensure either file or text input is provided
- Real-time feedback and loading states
- Bootstrap-styled responsive interface

### Template Structure
- `base.html`: Layout template with navigation and common elements
- `index.html`: Main form interface extending base template
- Flash message system for user feedback

## Data Flow

1. User accesses the web interface
2. User either uploads a JSON file or pastes JSON data
3. Form submission triggers backend processing
4. JSON data is validated for required structure
5. Valid data is converted to Anki deck format using genanki
6. Generated .apkg file is served as download
7. Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs

### Expected JSON Structure
```json
{
  "deck_name": "Medical Terminology Deck",
  "cards": [
    {
      "question": "What is the mechanism of action of Aspirin?",
      "answer": "Irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes",
      "high_yield_flag": "high-yield",
      "notes": "Important for cardiology and pain management",
      "tags": "Pharmacology::NSAIDs::Aspirin",
      "image": ""
    },
    {
      "cloze_text": "{{c1::Myocardial infarction}} is caused by {{c2::coronary artery occlusion}}",
      "high_yield_flag": "high-yield",
      "notes": "Key concept for USMLE Step 1",
      "tags": "Cardiology::Pathophysiology"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Enhanced Field Options:
- **deck_name**: Name of the Anki deck (required)
- **question/answer**: For basic Q&A cards
- **cloze_text**: For cloze deletion cards using {{c1::text}} format
- **high_yield_flag**: Set to "high-yield" for red highlighting
- **notes**: Additional context information
- **tags**: Hierarchical tags using :: separator
- **image**: Image support with automatic download and embedding:
  - Simple: `"image": "filename.jpg"` (for local files)
  - Object: `"image": {"caption": "Description", "url": "https://..."}` (downloads and embeds)
  - URLs are automatically downloaded and embedded as local media files in .apkg
  - Images work offline after deck creation with no internet dependencies
